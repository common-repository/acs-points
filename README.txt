ACS Points Plugin

== Description ==

By installing the ACS Points Plugin in your e-shop cart, you give your customers the option to pick up their online order fast and easy from an ACS Smartpoint Locker or from an ACS store.

Especially with the ACS Smartpoint Lockers, the online store provides its customers the possibility to collect their order any time they wish (24/7), from the nearest ACS Smartpoint Locker, using a unique code (PIN) received on their mobile phone. At the same time, your customers have the unique option for the Greek market to pay for their online order by cash on delivery at the POS terminal of the locker, using their bank card (Visa, Mastercard).

Also, great importance has been given to the safety of the lockers, as the ACS Smartpoint Lockers have an alarm system and LED lighting, while the order is received without human contact, which allows the recipients to be safe, even in health crisis conditions, such as those of the COVID 19 pandemic.
